# Multi-Class-and-Multi-Label-SVM-Analysis-in-Anuran-Calls
This is a project designed to demonstrate advanced data science skills. It involves a deep analysis of the Anuran Calls (MFCCs) Dataset, focusing on multi-class and multi-label classification using Support Vector Machines (SVMs). The project explores binary relevance methods, Gaussian kernels, L1-penalized SVMs, and class imbalance remedies like SMOTE. Additionally, it includes K-Means clustering for unsupervised learning. Advanced evaluation metrics like Hamming loss and confusion matrices for multi-label classification are employed. This project is an excellent demonstration of handling complex, multi-dimensional data and showcases a high level of proficiency in machine learning techniques, making it an ideal addition to a portfolio for data scientist or analyst roles.
